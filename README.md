# Zathura Document Viewer Configuration File

## Overview

This repository contains my Zathura Document Viewer Configuration File. More
information on Zathura can be found here: [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)

## Theme

This configuration uses the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) colour scheme.
This allows for an aesthetic viewing experience as the Dracula theme inverts 
all PDF document colours.

## Usage

To use this configuration, place the `zathurarc` file in the following
directory.

```bash
~/.config/zathura/zathurarc
```
